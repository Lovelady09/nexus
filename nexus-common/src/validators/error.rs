/// This limit applies to all error fields in response messages like
/// `ChatJoinResponse`, `ChatLeaveResponse`, `UserCreateResponse`, etc.

///
/// These are short, snake_case identifiers used for programmatic error handling.
/// Examples: "not_found", "permission", "hash_mismatch", "protocol_error"
///
/// Current longest value is "protocol_error" (14 chars), so 16 provides margin.
