# Connection Monitor

The Connection Monitor feature allows administrators to view all active connections and file transfers on the server.

## Overview

Users with the `connection_monitor` permission can request a list of all currently connected sessions and active file transfers. This provides visibility into who is connected, from where, for how long, and what files are being transferred.

## Flow

```

## Connection Info Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `nickname` | `string` | Display name (equals username for regular accounts) |
| `username` | `string` | Account username (database key) |
| `ip` | `string` | Remote IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `port` | `u16` | Remote port number |
| `login_time` | `i64` | Unix timestamp when session logged in |
| `is_admin` | `bool` | Whether the user has admin privileges |
| `is_shared` | `bool` | Whether this is a shared account session |

## Transfer Info Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `nickname` | `string` | Display name (equals username for regular accounts) |
| `username` | `string` | Account username (database key) |
| `ip` | `string` | Remote IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `port` | `u16` | Remote port (7501 for TCP, 7503 for WebSocket) |
| `is_admin` | `bool` | Whether the user has admin privileges |
| `is_shared` | `bool` | Whether this is a shared account session |
| `direction` | `string` | Transfer direction: `"download"` or `"upload"` |
| `path` | `string` | File path being transferred |
| `total_size` | `u64` | Total file size in bytes (0 if unknown) |
| `bytes_transferred` | `u64` | Bytes transferred so far |
| `started_at` | `i64` | Unix timestamp when transfer started |

**Note:** The `direction` field is from the server's perspective:
- `"download"` = server sending to client (client is downloading)
- `"upload"` = client sending to server (client is uploading)

## Sorting

The server returns connections sorted alphabetically by nickname (case-insensitive). The client may re-sort by any column.

## Shared Accounts

For shared accounts, each session appears as a separate entry. The `nickname` field shows the session's display name, while `username` shows the underlying account name.

Example with a shared account "guests" having two sessions:

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "nickname": "visitor1",
      "username": "guests",
      "ip": "::ffff:192.168.1.50",
      "login_time": 1704067200,
      "is_admin": false,
      "is_shared": true
    },
    {
      "nickname": "visitor2",
      "username": "guests",
      "ip": "::ffff:192.168.1.51",
      "login_time": 1704067300,
      "is_admin": false,
      "is_shared": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| Not logged in | Request sent without valid session |
| Permission denied | User lacks `connection_monitor` permission |

## Notes

- Admin users automatically have all permissions, including `connection_monitor`
- The requesting user's own session is included in the results
- IP addresses are shown in their canonical form (IPv4-mapped IPv6 for IPv4 addresses)
- The `login_time` and `started_at` fields can be used to calculate duration
- Transfers are tracked separately from BBS connections (different ports)
- A user may have a BBS connection without any active transfers, or transfers without a BBS connection
- Transfer progress (`bytes_transferred`) is updated in real-time as data flows
